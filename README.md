# StyleTransferAlexnet

## Description 
On this task we took Stanford assignment 2: Style Transfer of CS20SI: TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research and change the VGG-19 to Alexnet implementation.

The task was setup on Tensorflow v1.3.0 and Python v3.5

Keep in mind that running the program for the first time will take a while because imagenet-caffe-alex.mat which weighing ~200MB. You can download the mat file separately from here: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-caffe-alex.mat

## History
Alexnet is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network for image classification that won the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.
